# pump-projects-s22
s22 projects hub! (march 2022 - present)

## Goal
Building side projects is one of the best ways to grow as a software engineer! I'm hoping to run a projects program where everyone participating will be able to build out (hopefully) one project fully end-to-end. This will hopefully enable everyone to be comfortable to contribute to the PuMP website.

## Starting up - March 17
We will be having a discussion on the potential projects you can do!

What areas do you want to focus on?
- Frontend / user-facing website
- Mobile development
- Backend development (CRUD, databases, web crawling?)
- Bonus project: scraping from a Google sheets and print `_direst` files

Potential projects:
- E-commerce shop
- Social media clone
- Discord bot
- Authentication systems
- Frontend specific projects: https://github.com/behnamazimi/practical-front-end-projects
- Backend specific projects: https://gist.github.com/MWins/41c6fec2122dd47fdfaca31924647499

Open questions:
- Frequency to meet?
- Setting up project repos next meet?
